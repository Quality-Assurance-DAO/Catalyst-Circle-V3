## <mark style="color:red;">General ADA holders nominations</mark>

### Dimitri Fernando

{% hint style="info" %}
**Experience of Project Catalyst - which roles have you fulfilled?**  CA Fund 6, CA and VCA Fund 7, VCA Flash Assessment Fund 7, Founder of South Asian Town Hall. Member of several groups like Cardano for Climate, Town Hall, Eastern Town Hall, Pacific Town Hall, Swarm, Catalyst Creatives, Community Listeners.

**Experience in the functional group you seek to represent:**  I am an ADA holder who has delegated to a stake pool. By participating in the above groups I am participating with like minded ADA holders. I am active in all the above mentioned groups on a weekly basis even though in all but the South Asian town hall, they are late night or after midnight and early morning/pre dawn meetings. That is my commitment to being part of these groups and communities. The respective members of the communities can vouch for my involvement.

**What do you see as the biggest concerns facing the functional group you hope to represent?** How best to satisfy our individual aspirations in the context of the best use of our ADA in the community. The infatuation with Cardano being to a large extent by developers for developers with the other communities and groups playing a peripheral role in terms of funding , and voices being heard. Sectors such as Environmental issues, Womens Issues, Childrens issues, Animal Rights, LGBTQ issues, Creative Endeavours, Mental and Emotional Health issues are not considered as vital for a thriving society. Soft skills projects are funded far less than technical projects. Funds are being allocated without accountability by the recipients. A large portion of funds allocated are for projects that never get built. THe beneficiaries are not held accountable. There is lack of transparency in these processes. Multiple ways of manipulation and gaming of funding is happening. Even in established groups there are countless projects being submitted by the same stakeholders , round after round. Voter blocs are being built to game the system. SPOs are dominating the rewards from ADA while the general ADA holders get a pittance.

**A key part of a Circle seat is to be a “sensor array" for opportunities/problems. How do you intend to engage with your functional group and bring existing and emerging issues in your community to the Circle?**  Have ability for ADA holders to reach me and discuss their individual issues or concerns, as well as put forward their ideas for improving the overall group. Group problems into groups and have those facing the problems to meet and discuss, and come up with implementable solutions.

**What key ideas or issues would you like to champion on behalf of your community?** Moving emphasis from developers to non developers and community users in different spheres. Having more access to key resource people from IOG at other Town hall meetings not only the European one. Bring about societal change by accessing the C Fund and DCF fund as a community not just where big companies can access these since they too are taking catalyst funding plus DCF funding and then dominating the markets. Why should only big companies get big funding? Why cant small companies, small community groups have access to that funding? What good is a technical centric society filled with techies only? Will that ever mainstream Cardano? I think not. Its enough time that developers had the spotlight. We need all other groups to have an chance to grow and shine as well. Otherwise this becomes a technical geekfest, nothing more. I want underrepresented geographical regions such as West Asia, North Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, South East Asia, Oceania, Central America , Pacific Islands, Inuit , Siberia, Mongolia, to have a voice in this community. IF you vote for me you will get a candidate who would stand for your voice to be heard and your rights represented.

**At the end of your term as a Circle Representative, what outcomes would represent success in your role?** Seeing a more balanced Community with equal emphasis on new developers and developments and regular users who constitute the bulk of any society. In fact create initiatives where all manner of users come on board with an 80/20 split of users to developers. Seeing causes like Environment, Food Security, Sustainable Agriculture, Sanctity of Life, Animal Rights, Creative Groups, Empowerment of Southern and Eastern Hemispheres, in terms of equality to other areas of earth, Empowerment of marginalized communities , LGBTQ initiatives and other diversity related initiatives, in various Aesthetic arts developed, People's emotional and mental well being considered as highly as technical benefits of blockchain, being formed and running smoothly.

**Is there anything else that you want voters to know as to why you would be a good fit for this seat on the Circle?** I am mature, empathetic, a marketer and seller, a story teller, passionate about what is right, true and honorable. My ethics are never situational and I value honor, integrity and the word of an individual. I have taken on roles in groups and communities from the age of 13, 35 years ago so have experience dealing with a wide range of individuals and issues. I am an Myers Briggs Type Indicator Accredited Trainer which means I work with corproates and individuals and understand different peoples personality types and can easily work with all of them. I am also an International Coaching Federation Coach in training, which means I have training and experience in how to help people achieve their goals and solve their problems by finding their solutions rather than giving them solutions. As such whatever solutions I an the other parrticipants arrive at it will be their solution not mine, hence they will embrace and execute wholeheartedly. I will vociferously and fearlessly represent the abovementioned causes, groups and communities . If you have heard me thus far at any of the Town Hall meetings, Gimbalabs, Swarm meetings, C4C meetings, you know very well that I am not afraid to speak my mind for the betterment of the community. That is part of my core nature. I believe that Cardano can become a driver of societal change and transformation if and only if all the members of society and community have equal value.

**A key part of a Circle seat is to be a “sensor array" for opportunities/problems. How do you intend to engage with your functional group and bring existing and emerging issues in your community to the Circle?** Sensing issues in recurring twitter spaces, by listening; reflect issues with community; present issue emergence and reflection to the Circle

**What key ideas or issues would you like to champion on behalf of your community?** Minimum ADA amount to vote; and can ADA holders be represented by just one or two people? Or would a federated approach be sensible?

**At the end of your term as a Circle Representative, what outcomes would represent success in your role? H**aving reduced the minimum amount to vote; ADA holders and voters feel well represented and heard: Referencing [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/11/13/the-general-perspective-on-staking-in-cardano/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/11/13/the-general-perspective-on-staking-in-cardano/) -> Engagement of **all** stakeholders -> Keeping the leverage of individual stakeholders low

**Is there anything else that you want voters to know as to why you would be a good fit for this seat on the Circle?** We run as a tandem, because this is possibly more than a fulltime job. Our focus is on compos-ability, interoperability, and connecting or improving communications for GenAda Holders. We will be like Basho, and since Cardano has entered into the Basho Era, we will apply some specifically abstract methods to understand the general lovelace holder's place in the belly of the beached whale on a sunny afternoon.

## <mark style="color:red;">Funded Proposers nominations</mark>

### Nebiyu Sultan

{% hint style="info" %}
**Experience of Project Catalyst – which roles have you fulfilled?** I am currently running a funded proposal from F5, and I'm also in the team of two other funded proposals funded in F6. I have also recommended one other funded proposal in F6 and participated in the voting rounds since fund 5.

**Experience in the functional group you seek to represent:** My participation in the Funded proposals is limited to the Eastern African Community, however i am eager to connect with, assist and represent other funded proposals from across the global community.

**What do you see as the biggest concerns facing the functional group you hope to represent?** Funded proposers need to understand that there is a vested interest in their project from the community. Without such an engagement with the community, it could lead to demotivation and mismanagement of funds, and in return the community to loose faith in the Catalyst process.

**A key part of a Circle seat is to be a “sensor array" for opportunities/problems. How do you intend to engage with your functional group and bring existing and emerging issues in your community to the Circle?** I hope to connect with funded proposers during various townhall breakout meetings on a regular basis. This will create the opportunity to engage with the funded proposals and allow them to air their grievances and suggestions on future improvements.

**What key ideas or issues would you like to champion on behalf of your community?** A visual platform for the community to easily follow on the progress of each funded proposal and engage with the various teams for further collaboration and updates.

**At the end of your term as a Circle Representative, what outcomes would represent success in your role?** Although i do not expect to accomplish the the work i feel is needed within the 3 month time period, I would like to lay down the ground work of the needed research and feedback from the community to enable my successor to start implementation. Additionally, I would like to make sure there are at least 5 applicants for the role after my term ends.

**Is there anything else that you want voters to know as to why you would be a good fit for this seat on the Circle?** Having been part of several teams that have been funded before, and also having engaged with other teams that have been funded, i have noticed unaired grievances and issues that will hurt Catalyst in the long run as the community grows. I believe my listening skills will be valuable to identify these issues and concerns of the wider functional group. Through my participation in the Circle, I would like to contribute my fair share to assist funded proposers and keep Catalyst growing.

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

### Alexandru Dragnescu

{% hint style="info" %}
**Experience of Project Catalyst – which roles have you fulfilled?**  I am familiar with Project Catalyst (including voting system) but I can't named it a big experience.

**Experience in the functional group you seek to represent:**  I'm an active member on forum.cardano.org especially on Pool Operators section.. where I am offering support for other POOL OPERATORS (how to build, configure, upgrade, fix issues with the pools). also I have few useful topics like how to build a POOL, I created a script for updating nodes, etc

**What do you see as the biggest concerns facing the functional group you hope to represent?** the biggest concerns for a POOL operator is to attract delegators (stake) for the pool... as u already know there are thousands of pool named SMALL pool which are supporting the decentralization by running nodes, but there is no compensation because the delegators were already delegated/staked with POOLs which are on top of the list...

**A key part of a Circle seat is to be a “sensor array" for opportunities/problems. How do you intend to engage with your functional group and bring existing and emerging issues in your community to the Circle?** By collecting informations frequently from the SPOs through different media (Twitter, Discord, forum, even meetings, etc)

**What key ideas or issues would you like to champion on behalf of your community? T**he delegation process; if we can decentralize/change the delegation system the the all stake amount \~70% will be spread over all pools, this way all pools will generate blocks and rewards needed for maintaining the servers, individual projects, etc

**At the end of your term as a Circle Representative, what outcomes would represent success in your role?** Decentralization of the delegation process;

**Is there anything else that you want voters to know as to why you would be a good fit for this seat on the Circle?** Being a pool operator I can say that I am aware about the issues regarding the delegation process
{% endhint %}

### Sergiu Cazan

{% hint style="info" %}
**Experience of Project Catalyst – which roles have you fulfilled?**  Not really:)

**Experience in the functional group you seek to represent:**  Yes, running a pool since 31.05.2021

**What do you see as the biggest concerns facing the functional group you hope to represent?**  Difficulty in gathering new ' real fi' delegators on new small SPOs

**A key part of a Circle seat is to be a “sensor array" for opportunities/problems. How do you intend to engage with your functional group and bring existing and emerging issues in your community to the Circle?**  A lot of Twitter/Discord/Telegram work

**What key ideas or issues would you like to champion on behalf of your community?** Changing the world must have a lot of delegators education involved. I'm really 100% besides changing the world and replacing at least part of the broken financial system we're on will take a lot of 'RealFi' talk, education and convincing to new delegators. If network is to be secure and succesful we need people to get into Cardano with full knowledge about decentralisation, proof of stake and of course a little incentive in the form of their rewards. This last part is missing if a small SPO brings in new delegators that can't benefit from the rewards from the start. Their experience is not complete

**At the end of your term as a Circle Representative, what outcomes would represent success in your role?**  More ADA staked to Single SPO pools, and preferably mission driven ones.

**Is there anything else that you want voters to know as to why you would be a good fit for this seat on the Circle?**  I'm a double economist and really understand current financial system we're working on replacing and I'm very pasionate about Cardano ecosystem. I also have a business of my own, worked previously in customer care, product management and of course people management. I belive I have the power to be objective when needed, define SMART Objectives and also listen to people when the situation demands it.

### Filip Blagojević

{% hint style="info" %}
**Experience of Project Catalyst – which roles have you fulfilled?** I am actively participating in Project Catalyst since Fund 2. I've been a CA in each Fund since Fund 2 and VCA in each fund since Fund 3, except Fund 7. I have actively suggested development of tools and procedures and early tested some of them, Yellow and Red Card thing for example. I was an active member of the Swarm team, actively organized the first Ideafest, held many breakout rooms and different community discussions about various subjects regarding Catalyst and governance in general. I held sessions in the Catalyst School about Catalyst in general and specific sessions for CAs and VCAs.

**Experience in the functional group you seek to represent:**  I've been a CA in each Fund since Fund 2 and VCA in each Fund since Fund 3, except Fund 7. I participate in Telegram discussions, especially when there is tension due to misunderstanding. I have commented and tested tools through the Funds. I held sessions for Catalyst School.

**What do you see as the biggest concerns facing the functional group you hope to represent?**  The CA group is scaling rapidly and it is required of us to upscale our operations to preserve the quality that the voters and proposers deserve. Onboarding processes need to be quicker and more efficient, amount of knowledge necessary to be a CA is steadily growing. Different stakeholders of Cardano need to be included, especially highly technical people.

**A key part of a Circle seat is to be a “sensor array" for opportunities/problems. How do you intend to engage with your functional group and bring existing and emerging issues in your community to the Circle?**  I plan to more actively participate and engage in Telegram and Discord, follow the developments in the Iterative Dropbox and ping proposers from that sheet to follow-up on their work. I plan to open a weekly Zoom call which would be an open space for CAs to come and share their thoughts and concerns. Of course, I would encourage people to message me via Discord and Telegram if they need help.

**What key ideas or issues would you like to champion on behalf of your community?**  I would particularly like to work on the financial sustainability of the CA position because I believe that is the only way to have people professionally participate for longer periods of time. I would champion the idea of educating ourselves as CAs on a daily basis - on whatever subject we lack the most.

**At the end of your term as a Circle Representative, what outcomes would represent success in your role?**  I would like to establish CAs in the wider Cardano community as a serious group of dedicated, respected, hardworking and honest people. I think VCAs should be regarded as sort of professionals in their work so I would go in the way of transparently and honestly displaying data that proves CAs and VCAs do an amazing job and getting better Fund after Fund.

**Is there anything else that you want voters to know as to why you would be a good fit for this seat on the Circle?**  My activities in Catalyst moved me to quitting my job and dedicating full-time to work in and around Cardano. I am very familiar with Catalyst, but I have a pretty decent technical understanding, I am an Emurgo Academy student and I dedicate my complete work life to Cardano. I do not shy away from difficult subjects and discussions and I bring focus on the solutions and the work that needs to be done. Thank you for your consideration!
{% endhint %}

### Tomi Astikainen

**Experience of Project Catalyst – which roles have you fulfilled?** I've been a VCA, a CA, a Challenge Team member, a mentor, a proposer and a voter. Joined and became active in Fund3.

**Experience in the functional group you seek to represent:**  I use about 2-4 hours a day to participate and to try and improve things in Catalyst. &#x20;

Because it's the role of the CAs to help proposers and voters, I don't limit myself to the CA discussion groups only. I comment in Ideascale to link similar proposals and I help new proposers crystallise their ideas. As a Challenge Team member I have even gone to the extent to check unready proposals and, after confirmation from the proposer, I have notified IOG to withdraw them to make sure other CAs don't need to spend time in assessing draft proposals.

I operate from the standpoint of high integrity and honesty. Before assessment stage, I make sure we have proposed all necessary challenges for the next fund. When assessing proposals I don't shy away from being critical, even if it's not always in my interest to do so within the limits of the prevailing incentive model. As a proposer I flag 4-5 star assessments on my own proposals if they don't make sense. As a VCA I first focus on understanding what type of action would most benefit the community and only then choose how to use my limited resources.

I have a natural tendency of "community sensing" and connecting people to one another. I already have a good network of CA colleagues and I hope to help activate as many of them as possible in our common mission to make Catalyst the biggest and brightest open innovation platform in the world. I am confident in my ability to do so. A leader is successful when the team says "we did it".

**What do you see as the biggest concerns facing the functional group you hope to represent?**

Lately there has been a lot of divisive noise but I feel that overcoming the obstacles has made us stronger and we are becoming more unified.

We need to constantly balance between the volunteer drive and incentivised contributions. A large part of the process is still without incentives and many people get tired of contributing when they are not recognized for their efforts.

Finally, the culture of inclusion and listening for better co-innovation only becomes possible when there's enough diversity, a level playing field and a sense of true belonging. Those are some of the areas I would make sure to improve.

We have an entire "idea dropbox" as a backlog of work to be done. Based on this, IOG has outlined the next steps: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1\_\_RZNfCB3v-0jqOg1zQyStpgeL1hUaegGIhPhT-p8YI/edit?usp=drivesdk](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1\_\_RZNfCB3v-0jqOg1zQyStpgeL1hUaegGIhPhT-p8YI/edit?usp=drivesdk)  ****  This doesn't have to be the actual roadmap for the coming funds but it's a great starting point.

**A key part of a Circle seat is to be a “sensor array" for opportunities/problems. How do you intend to engage with your functional group and bring existing and emerging issues in your community to the Circle?**&#x20;

I'm already doing this. Anyone who has followed the Catalyst Community Advisors Telegram Group knows that I'm one of the most active participants. I am there to co-innovate, learn and connect people behind the best development ideas. Occasionally I sweep the Discord discussions too.

In this role I would also liaise with IOG and other relevant stakeholders but my key focus would still to be active listening of the CA community. Ideally we will outgrow Telegram and establish better, more structured and fruitful communication in the upcoming CA Portal.

Rather than driving my own improvement ideas, I would like to suggest a weekly recurring process that is open and transparent for anyone to join.

Example:

Each week one improvement suggestion is championed by one of the CAs and taken through the same process.

WEDNESDAY

* Progress report (one slide)
* Question of the week (survey link)
* After Townhall to coordinate next week's work

THURSDAY

* Prioritization of work

FRIDAY-SATURDAY-SUNDAY

* Insights from the community
* In-depth discussion (Swarm)
* Draft for solution(s)

MONDAY

* Finalized solution document

TUESDAY

* Townhall Preparation: picking the Question of the Week and making the progress report

...and so it goes, agile and ever-evolving. The feedback to this initial idea was very good. Now all I need is a mandate to execute the plan.

**What key ideas or issues would you like to champion on behalf of your community?** I wish to lead and facilitate the process of renewing the Catalyst process, not alone but by creating heroes and heroines in the CA community ("sub-circle of CAs").

I use agile methods and design thinking to understand what needs to be done. Then I make sure that the best people take the best initiatives forward with the community's best interests in mind.

By ushering in a new era of results oriented collaboration, my intention is to help fix one thing every week to "decrease the inventory" of what needs to be done, while allowing room for IOG, Circle and the CA sub-circle to focus on more long term development. This would make the CA contributions more visible and appreciated in the community and open doors for new leaders to emerge.

**At the end of your term as a Circle Representative, what outcomes would represent success in your role?**  It depends if it's three or six months. If latter, I hope to have convinced IOG they can trust the CAs' and VCAs' ability to run and develop Catalyst independently. Our collaboration tools would have improved. There'd be a process for continuous improvement that my successor can easily take over. Finally, the culture and team spirit would be on a whole new level.

**Is there anything else that you want voters to know as to why you would be a good fit for this seat on the Circle?**  Liked the IOG's idea regarding a CA Portal? I can probably help design and implement that, too. I design online communities for living. My current client has approximately 100,000 employees so, no, I'm not afraid to build global solutions that scale.
