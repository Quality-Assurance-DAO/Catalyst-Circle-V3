This meeting took place 1 day before the voting results for fund 8 were released. \
\
In fund 8, [this proposal](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/403551) aimed to secure the funding for Circle's operations: Circle members, Circle Admin, Treasurers, and Mentors.\

The proposal was not successful.\

At the time of writing, it is unclear what the future of Circle will be.
