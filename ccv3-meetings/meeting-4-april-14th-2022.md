## 1. Opening, agenda (0:00)

Check-in (0:11**)**\
****Announcements (4:41) – none\
Agenda and align expectations (4:52) – no items added.

## 2. Circle stand-up (6:44)

**Nori (6:44)** Circle Stand-up has been slightly changed based on feedback from Audit Circle and QA-DAO: each Circle member in turn should say:

* **Reporting:** what you have worked on since last meeting, and what issues were brought up by the community you represent (so not just about your own perspective). Also for transparency, report any decisions made outside meetings, e.g. in Slack, since the last meeting.
* **Enabling**: anything blocking you, anything you need help with
* **Intention**: what you and your community will be working on in the next 2 weeks.

Relate your comments to the cards on the [Prioritised Problems GitHub board](https://github.com/orgs/Catalyst-Circle/projects/8/views/1).

### Unassigned cards (8:18)

* [Method for selecting Catalyst Technical Council](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/59) – originally Kenric’s in CCv2, so was transferred to Nadia. Assigned to Nadia and Harris, and will stay in Backlog for now.
* [Faster funding for Catalyst projects](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/52) – moved to “circle reset” – Circle will discuss offline to check everyone is OK with the final status of this ticket.
* [Improve awareness of project Catalyst](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/49) – assigned to Harris
* [No systems to track trust and participation](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/37) – assigned to Joey

### **Card on " Professional Consideration of CCv3 Roles"**

**Nori 13:34** Question raised by Audit Circle – we need clarity on status of [Professional Consideration of CCv3 roles and time spent on work](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/74). Its status is currently showing as integrated/accepted, which means Circle has accepted that it is an issue, and agreed to the solution shown. But is that the case? The status of a card should reflect the opinion of the Circle as a whole, not any individual person; so should it be “cancelled” “rejected”?\
**Harris (14:43)** Originally the card was about how to appropriately reward Circle members, but then it turned into proposals that Dimitri submitted.\
**Nori (15:28)** The card says that Circle members should be paid more, and retroactively; and there was disagreement in Circle on that. So is it officially accepted by the Circle? Or is it only an individual proposal, and rejected as a Circle issue?\
**Nadia (16:29)** We could reject this card, but create a new card and discuss the issue of Circle members’ future pay, independently of this proposal and independently of retroactive funding.\
**Nori (17:52)** Formal vote – unanimous to move this card to Rejected.

### **Mercy (14:33)**

* Had a good meeting with IOG, facilitated by Harris, about [exact timing of release of funds](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/75), gave a better understanding of how it works. Status now is, waiting on Danny and Marek to work out details and get back to us. On [Treasury to support admin, governance and community projects to become sustainable](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/77), will circle this back to Harris during his update.
* Future - on [exact timing of release of funds](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/75), once Danny and Marek finalise the details, the Funded Proposers sub-circle will communicate it to the community via a one-pager.
* No blockers, except perhaps Danny and Marek’s workload, as they are busy working on the voting app.

### **Harris (24:54)**

* [Initiating a code of conduct for Circle](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/83) – Circle have discussed in Slack, but will need to deliberate further. There has not been a breakout meeting.  To be discussed later in this meeting.&#x20;
* On [Treasury to support admin, governance and community projects to become sustainable](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/77) – no specific progress made.&#x20;
* On [Improve awareness of project Catalyst](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/49), IOG has some initiatives planned to address this.&#x20;
* On [how to remove IOG from every decision](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/47) - adjustments to what the Circle does, and the concept of the Catalyst Technical Council, are some directions we can go in, but there has been no progress.&#x20;
* On [Lack of onboarding structures](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/56) I am not sure.&#x20;
* On [developing governance and developer ecosystem](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/51), we want to avoid duplication of effort; there is some IO work happening on partnerships, but I have not taken any specific action.&#x20;
* I hope to be able to share some information some time in the future.

### **Dimitri (29:00)**

* I’ve been in various Twitter groups, correcting misconceptions, telling people Circle reps don’t have decision making power and don’t get preferential treatment on funding. Also worked with Nadia on Monday on developing Circle code of conduct.&#x20;
* On [anti-scammers initiative on social media](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/45), we should discuss it as Circle; I am not aware what progress has been made until now.&#x20;
* On [Nurturing a listening culture](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/69), no change since last meeting; I noted down my own feelings on it, but we need to discuss it as a group.

<mark style="color:red;">**ACTION ITEM:**</mark> Dimitri, Joey and Rhys to form a working party to progress [Nurturing a listening culture](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/69)

### **Nadia (32:42)**

* Had a meeting to discuss the Prioritised Problems process with Tevo and Stephen. A helpful rubric on how to frame a problem; I used it to add a new problem to the board, [CA/vCA Community Needs to Prioritize and Solve F8 Sensed Issues for Fund 9](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/87) – this comprises c. 33 issues; the sensing of them is done, and I’ve gone through the other 3 questions in the rubric for them as a group:\
  &#x20;\- Why is solving this problem important to the mission of Project Catalyst\
  &#x20;\- Can you articulate the gap between the current state and the expected or envisioned state?\
  &#x20;\- How might the value of solving this problem be quantified and/or measured?
* The CA/VCA group communications team has been creating a process to  work on these 33 issues; this will be a model for how problems could be solved (see later agenda item).
* I added the problem [proposer group and the proposal process itself lack official representation for issue solving](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/88). Mercy brought it up; we held an After Town Hall on Fund 8 process, and will hold another one this week. It raises a wider issue of who should become the owner of issues related to the proposing process, and should there be a representative?

**Harris (36:44**) Are you involving Challenge Teams in this? because ultimately some oversight of proposer issues could be done by them.\
**Nadia (37:03)** We have brought everyone together in an After Town Hall, but if some of the issues should be addressed by challenge teams, that's feasible.

### **Joey (39:34)**

* On [Review and revise the prioritised problems workflow](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/86) – we had some discussions; Nadia’s meeting on Monday came up with a method but nothing is finally resolved.&#x20;
* On [Systems to track trust and participation](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/37),  I have yet to meet with people who are trying to create a token for trust.  And on the other problems I own, I haven’t had a chance to do anything on them; some of them are still just community ideas, there are no projects going on underneath them.&#x20;
* On [Lack of onboarding systems](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/56), I attended a Town Hall yesterday with George Lovegrove; they have a fund 8 proposal for some infrastructure analysis, which might lead to something that will address this card.

<mark style="color:red;">**ACTION ITEM**</mark>: Joey to meet with George Lovegrove to find out more.

### **Dumpling (41:53)**

* I only have one card, the communications gap. I met with Jeremy and Alex from CF, and with a new partnership manager at CF to hear how I could assist him in connecting with the community. What has the community brought up – see  later agenda item in this meeting, but briefly I see a new area of work to help with the community and CF. I have made no decisions outside meetings.
* Future – I would like to work on the consent agenda.
* Blockers – waiting to discuss issues I’ve raised for discussion in later agenda items.                                                                                                      &#x20;

### **Rhys (43:41)**

* On [Involve SPOs in Catalyst projects](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/50) – largely finished this work.&#x20;
* On [Lack of permanent Miscellaneous challenge](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/55), I’m talking to some SPOs to figure out what would be an appropriate challenge setting for SPOs; ideally only one to avoid confusion.&#x20;
* On [Nurturing a listening culture](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/69) , in my opinion that is what Circle is for overall.
* On [Systems to track trust and participation](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/37) – I spoke to people involved in Atala PRISM to see if there is an easy-to-implement solution – there is, of course, but I also have recently seen Lido’s tools and he already has a tracking system in place so I plan to talk to him, and then to work with Joey on this ticket to create a system to track trust within Catalyst.&#x20;
* On [Lack of onboarding structures](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/56)  I met with Catalyst School, and also am working with Tevo on how we could create a centralised hub for onboarding; to kind of get some documentation together, create a plan and a scope of works. Also – on the discussion last meeting about misinformation about Circle’s role: I have found that people are hearing information from people who have very little to do with Catalyst, and this is where information is getting blown out of proportion. I’ve had to join Twitter Spaces and interrupt conversations to correct misinterpretations, particularly accusations that Circle has somehow been trying to push Dimitri out; we haven’t, and Dimitri himself has said he does not think we have. But there has been miscommunication, which I think we should address sooner rather than later.
* Future – will meet with Joey and Dimitri to move forward on  [Nurturing a listening culture](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/69). By next meeting, I should be able to present my work on [Lack of onboarding structures](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/56). Will hold a breakout room at next After Town Hall for SPO issues.
* No blockers.

**Nori (49:14)** Question on status of the card  [Involve SPOs in Catalyst projects](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/50)\
<mark style="color:red;">**ACTION ITEM:**</mark> Rhys to format the card for [Involve SPOs in Catalyst projects](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/50) using the new rubric, and fill in data on actions taken and outcomes, prior to closing the card in the next meeting.

### CCv4 Elections Process

**Harris (53:10)** I have added a card for [Define the process for CCv4 elections](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/89). – we do have some time, but need to start thinking about it soon. There is an intent that we have each seat as a challenge setting, and have a vote as though each individual is a proposal.\
<mark style="color:red;">**ACTON ITEM:**</mark> Harris to add this as an agenda item for a future meeting.
