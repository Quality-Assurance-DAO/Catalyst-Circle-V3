## **1. Opening, agenda (0:00)**

**Check-in (0:36)**

**Announcements (6:54)** – none

**Agenda and align expectations (7:10)** –Items added to the agenda: sustainability for core services in Catalyst; update on conversations about Circle pay; update on the letter about d-Reps from the community to IOG.

## **2. Circle Stand-Up (13:44)**

NOTE: The Stand-up is a go-round using the [Prioritised Problems GitHub board](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/projects/3), where each Circle member in turn says

* what they have worked on since last meeting
* what they will be working on next
* any blocks, or anything they need help with

**Joey (14:14)**

* Met with Circle mentor \[_Tevo Saks_], and with Aharon {_Porath, who also stood for election to CCv3_] to discuss Toolmakers problems on the board; still not agreed which problems are still ongoing, and what the criterion is for “it’s finished”, so Joey will wait till they have met again before finalising
* Will have regular meetings with Tevo and Aharon every 2 weeks.
* Blocked by confusion getting used to times in UTC, but otherwise good.

&#x20;                  ****                  &#x20;

**Nadia (17:57)**

* Updating the CA Guide, together with CA community, with info from IOG about new tools; lots of good collaboration. Begun drafting a VCA guide. Submitted a proposal for a  rapid funding Treasury for the CAs Subcircle; aiming to address the issue of burnout and “proposal fatigue” and to have an experiment in a governance framework for the CA group.
* Will continue to work on onboarding CAs, and reaching out to other sections of the community
* No blockers.

&#x20;

**Dumpling (21:56)**

* Developed a 3-step plan to address communication gap between CF and Catalyst community: Surveys to community on Twitter about how much they know about CF’s role in Catalyst (so far, 60% of those voting have no idea); Discord channel for discussions; and got support from [Frederik](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/gregaard) \[_Frederik Gregaard, CF’s CEO_] for an open discussion event.
* Open discussion event will be 31st March, 9:15 UTC: Frederik and others from CF, and Felix \[_Weber, from Swarm_] will discuss with the community about CF’s involvement with Catalyst. The event won’t be decision-making; just for CF to hear from the community.
* Blocker – would like Circle members to come to the Discord server and join Twitter space.

&#x20;****&#x20;

**Harris (25:57)**

* The [Catalyst Parameters Pilot](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/63) will be delayed and de-prioritised, so for the time being, Circle will remain as a sensing organisation, not a decision-making one; there are things in the works that will clarify its future role. There’s been discussions in IOG about how we make decisions – Harris met the IO Leadership team, legal team, etc last week. Also met Wallet team re: some new features that are planned.
* Will be sharing details of these things with the community in coming weeks, but cannot do so yet. Will also be able to move some of the other tickets on the board soon, e.g. “[IOG transitioning from governors to service providers](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/47)”. There will also be some follow-up from IOG to the community’s letter about d-Reps. Will add to the board some specific workshops to share updates with the community. Harris will take on new role of Governance Technologies, so focusing on voting mechanisms and voting tools. What will the future role of Circle be?
* Main blocker is time; has not had time to engage with Circle members except a short meeting with Nadia.

&#x20;

**Mercy (32:11)**

* Formed a Funded Proposers Subcircle, very representative in terms of time zones; have held one After Town Hall. And Mercy’s slides at Town Hall generated good discussions; Item added to this meeting’s agenda based on that. A Fund 8 proposal has been submitted to [support the Sub-Circle](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398211)’s work
* Funded proposers would like more ways to meet each other, build collaborations, etc but don’t always have time to do it in a meeting – so perhaps a platform like a proposal directory or search engine? This will be added as a problem on the board. Harris is working on the issues around [timing of when funding is released](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Prioritized-Problems/issues/75) so hope to hear more on that at next Circle meeting.
* No blockers.

&#x20;

**Dimitri (40:02)**

* Talking to individuals I know and groups I belong to about what they expect from me, and what problems they want to address. Attended Eastern Town Hall. Held After Town Hall sessions – nobody attended the last one, but the previous week’s was large. Talked to Allison \[ _mentor from Circle v2_]. Created two surveys - there were not a great number of replies (47:34), but issues raised include:
*
  * numbers of Circle seat s should reflect the number of constituents, i.e General ADA holders from different geographical regions should comprise the bulk of Circle;
  * bodies around Circle such as admin, treasury and oversight should be elected by the community;
  * governance work should not be reliant on proposals; Circle members should receive enough money to do the job in a professional manner;
  * information silos;
  * dReps.
  * (46:12) A second [survey](https://forms.gle/KTwxc7eLB7KtGTYK6) was in favour of a retrospective funding bid to pay Circle reps more than what was previously allocated; so Dimitri submitted [a proposal](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/397306)
* Planning to attend Africa Town Hall and Pacific Town Hall. Will set up a Reddit account for General ADA Holders

&#x20;

**Rhys (52:07)**

* Supported SPOs to submit proposals, often around providing infrastructure. Ran workshops, Spaces etc encouraging SPOs to get involved in Catalyst and also work together; facilitated around 15 new proposals for what SPOs actually need to support them. Also been doing interviews about proposals to increase their reach. Partly this was developed by liaising with [Becky Hopwood](https://iohk.io/en/team/rebecca-hopwood-1) \[_IOHK community co-ordinator_].
* Plans to use rapid funding Circle budget to help SPOs get more eyes on their proposals - perhaps via ads in Twitter spaces. May be able to hold breakout rooms on IOG Discord, which will reach about 250 SPOs – liaising with Becky Hopwood on this.
* No blockers.

**Harris (58:26)** Are the reactions in the community towards Catalyst positive?

**Rhys (58:44)** Definitely improving; there is more interest. Until now, many SPOs expect to do things for free; but actually it does cost them money; so I am trying to encourage them to change that mentality and see Catalyst as a funding mechanism because their work supports the community.
