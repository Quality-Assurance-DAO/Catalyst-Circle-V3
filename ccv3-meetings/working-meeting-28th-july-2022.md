## Meeting summary

Viability of voting with Catalyst app **1:32**

Representation, and how to define “a community” for voting purposes? **3:28**

What are the requirements for a voting mechanism for Circle? **10:06**

Video presentation from DripDropz on how their voting mechanism works **10:38**

DripDropz is on-chain, fully trackable – but no privacy **12:15**

One coin, one vote – are other options possible? **14:07**

Snapshots, DIDs, and  ways to determine who can vote and voting power **14:53**

Increasing engagement **17:11**

Should people be able to change their vote after voting? **18:41**

DripDropz can definitely offer “one person, one vote”, but it won’t scale well **20:39**

Whitelisting and/or wallet registration **22:30**

DripDropz has an F9 proposal to open-source their voting app **24:25**

Timelines; and would we get more participation with the Catalyst app? **26:14**

How quickly could a DripDropz vote for Circle be implemented? **30:16**

How would voting power be determined for a Circle vote? **32:21**        &#x20;

How voting power was determined in DripDropz’ initial vote **33:42**

Should voters be a select group, e.g. those with IdeaScale accounts? **37:10**

Email privacy, GDPR **41:22**

IdeaScale is not secure **42:27**

For now , “one coin, one vote”, but quadratic voting could change that in future **43:24**

Plural voting **45:16**

Let’s take the simplest approach even if it upsets people **45:55**

Announce a snapshot in advance, so people can accumulate ADA for it? **47:23**

What’s the election for? Just Circle reps, or also vote on rewards for Circle members? **48:42**

Anything can be gamed – so let’s just test it **50:05**

Silent snapshot would prevent wallet gaming **51:06**

Could require wallets to be staked, so they are not brand new **53:17**

Practicalities of using a nameless token, and potential gaming the system **54:39**

Why would we \*not\* use the Catalyst app? in view of privacy and risk of coercion **1:00:03**

Using DripDropz is more decentralised, auditable, better UX **1:05:38**

Community-built solutions advance self-governance **1:07:19**

Thought the Catalyst app was not viable – but actually, it is **1:11:51**

DripDropz can create the vote, but we cannot guarantee a good turnout **1:15:22**

Thousands already us the Catalyst app, so participation will be high **1:20:27**

Process for deciding on a voting mechanism? **1:21:48**

Agree Catalyst app would be the best solution, but it wouldn’t be the most popular **1:24:53**

Could there be a transition process from Catalyst app to DripDropz? **1:25:35**

Let’s offer all the different methods and see which one people choose **1:28:59**

Africa Town Hall  and geographical representation**1:32:51**

Inviting people to nominate selves and define own communities and roles **1:40:10**

Plans for F10 proposal voting **1:49:47**

Does CCv3 end in September, or January? **1:56:19**

&#x20;

Meeting ends **1:57:59**
