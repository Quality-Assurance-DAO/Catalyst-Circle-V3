### Abbreviations used/Glossary <a href="#abbreviations-used-glossary" id="abbreviations-used-glossary"></a>

## 1. Opening, agenda (0:00) <a href="#1.-opening-agenda-0-00" id="1.-opening-agenda-0-00"></a>

Welcome and check-in **(0:02)**\
****Announcements **(4:09)** \
Agenda and align expectations **(7:52)** - added "Circle structure and legitimacy".

**Nori (9:46)** Circle agreed in the last meeting \[_summariser's note: it's unclear where this agreement happened; it wasn't in the last meeting_] to refocus around the CCv4 election planning, and not to use the GitHub board until CCv4. Is that still the consensus?\
**Harris (10:19)** We should address the CCv4 election; but should also discuss what the makeup of Circle should be.\
**Quasar (10:53)** I want some clarification on Harris's comment about not focusing on the problem statement, but on legitimacy of Circle. Which one is priority? And what counts as doing that, and not doing that?\
**Nori (11:39)** I'll add "Circle structure and legitimacy" before "Election planning".\
**Mercy (12:20)** A roundtable discussion \[_i.e. on Circle legitimacy, structure, and CCv4 election_] would be good to figure out what everyone feels is a priority.

## 2. Circle stand-up <a href="#2.-circle-stand-up-9-06" id="2.-circle-stand-up-9-06"></a>

There was no Circle Stand-up in this meeting, and the Prioritised Problems Board was not addressed.&#x20;

## 3. Consent agenda <a href="#3.-consent-agenda-1-07-01" id="3.-consent-agenda-1-07-01"></a>

### Funded Proposer subcircle formation and funding clarification (Mercy, 13:44)

**Mercy (15:14)** How the FP subcircle emerged, with a focus on global perspectives and inviting representatives from different Town Halls\
**(17:21)** Used the Fund 7 Rapid Funding to set up the SubCircle, get it going, and run it from Feb to May; then submitted an F8 proposal to fund it from June to Sept \[_summariser's note: actually October_]. Then we have used Â£600 of our F8 Rapid Funding to fund translations of the proposer guidance notes into Spanish, Portuguese, French, Arabic and Swahili; the Rapid Funding is being held by Treasury Guild and released when we need it.\
**(18:46)** Outline of the work the Subcircle has been doing - extensive problem-sensing via regional TownHalls and day-to-day interactions; collating sensed problems on our Miro board and working through them; regular presence at Coordinator meetings to hold discussions and get feedback from proposers; working with IOG to get a more definite calendar for funding release; writing guidance notes for Ideascale proposal submission form, and getting them translated; liaising with Nadia and the PA group, and contributing to the PA guidance notes. \
Happy to take any questions; and there have been some comments on GitHub that are unclear, but suggest someone disagrees, so happy to hear suggestions for how this could be done better.

**Quasar (22:37)** I don't have any questions for Mercy. The comments I made about Mercy in Slack and in GitHub were not intended to question how funds were used, and were not meant to be personal. Dimitri and I were trying to figure out how to request funds from Rapid Funding.

**Nadia (26:19)** It's really easy for us to go to the source with each other and respectfully request information of someone if it's if it's needed. I think it's it's really challenging to have a team operate like a team, if we're not treating each other like we're all on the same team.&#x20;

**Felix (28:03)** As well as having an agenda of topics we will talk about, we should consider _how_ we want to address those topics and what we want to achieve. Being unclear about that, to ourselves and to the community, makes us ineffective.

### PA updates (Nadia, 34:59)

**Nadia (35:14)** As I suggested in last week's working meeting, I approached the other nominees for CCv3 to see if they were available to function as PA rep when I leave. Filip is not, but Tomi is. It makes sense because he's very involved in the PA community. He is on holiday this week, so I have come to this meeting to announce it; when he returns, he will pick things up. I will be available to hand over, and then I will be moving to other work in the PAs' working groups.

### Circle structure and legitimacy (37:34)

**Key points:**

**Nori (37:34)** We began this at last week's working meeting: there is a [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOtZ6my8=/) with notes\
**Nori (38:05)** Although the CCv4 election is a priority because of the urgency of the timing, there is a lot of discussion around Circle's structure and legitimacy, so let's start there.\
**Harris  (38:35)** On the election - we can use any method to collect candidates' names and platform information - IdeaScale, Google form, or any other way - and that information can be loaded on the back end \[_i.e. of the voting app]_, so it could still be part of the F9 vote even though we have missed the deadline for doing it in the same way as we submit proposals. We could even have separate ballots for different purposes. But I think the biggest discussion is, are we going to let each respective group run their own elections, in which case we don't need this more general election?\
**Steve (40:20)** For legitimacy and to satisfy criticism about how Circle is elected, we should ask anyone who wants to be on v4 to submit their name in the _DAOs Love Cardano_ challenge. It's easy, and would solve most of the criticisms.\
**Joey (43:12)** I also like Ideascale, because people are familiar with it; but best to keep it separate from the Fund vote. Another idea - the software used by the Project Management Institute; it uses video where the candidates answer questions.\
**Nori (44:22)** We could add a template to Ideascale for candidates to answer questions.\
**Felix (44:39)** Let's avoid circling back over old ground - let's pick a solution and make it happen. It doesn't have to be be the best solution.\
**Kriss (49:56)** Subcircles are all different; so maybe we don't need to define the size of a subcircle. I feel the Circle election is for these specific seats; but the subcircles can be more dynamic.\
**Quasar (51:31)** Should we change the cadence of when Circles are elected?\
**Harris (55:56)** To reiterate, we don't have to stick to the deadline of the 30th. We could side-load the information for the Circle election, and have it appear in the app as part of the F9 vote; **or** we could wait until the end of the F9 vote, and then load the Circle voting information, via Ideascale or any other method, and have a separate voting event.\
**Nori (57:41)** I've noticed, from facilitating several Circles, that some seats struggle to connect with their communities. So perhaps we are approaching things backwards to elect a seat and then expect them to go and find their community. If a community is strong enough to self-organise and select a representative, then that rep doesn't need to "problem-sense" - the group is already doing it, so they would be "problem-reporting". In a holocratic model, there's no "election" for who comes in - each group decides who the link person will be, and sends someone to the Circle.\
**Felix (1:00:34)** We could do it the way that Catalyst GPS says. Instead of functional groups, use topics, such as "Community and outreach" or "Governance and identity". So Circle could copy what has already been pioneered with the PAs and VPAs, instead of trying to reach a decision ourselves. We should give it a try, because they have spent a lot of time working on it.\
**Harris (1:02:52)** That was the idea of the Wiki survey - to hear ideas from the community, from the PAs and other groups.\
Nori For concrete action items: there was the Pol.is survey, then an After Town Hall to get community input on the voting process; and then on voting, IdeaScale seems popular - I would love to see someone come up with a proposal on exactly how we would use it.

<mark style="color:red;">**ACTION ITEM:**</mark> Felix, Rhys and Joey to coordinate an ATH next week to get community input on how to do the vote.
