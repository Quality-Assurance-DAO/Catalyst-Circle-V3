## 1. Opening, agenda (0:00) <a href="#1.-opening-agenda-0-00" id="1.-opening-agenda-0-00"></a>

Welcome and check-in **(0:02)**\
****Announcements **(4:09)** \
Agenda and align expectations **(7:52)**&#x20;

**Nori (9:46)** Circle agreed in the last meeting to refocus around the CCv4 election planning, and not to use the GitHub board until CCv4.\
**Harris (10:19)** We should address the CCv4 election; but should also discuss what the makeup of Circle should be.\
**Quasar (10:53)** I want some clarification from Harris regarding his comment of not focusing on the problem statement, but on legitimacy of Circle. Which one is priority? And what counts as doing that, and not doing that?\
**Nori (11:39)** I'll add "Circle structure and legitimacy" before "Election planning".\
**Mercy (12:20)** A roundtable discussion \[_i.e. on Circle legitimacy, structure, and CCv4 election_] would be good to figure out what everyone feels is a priority.

## 2. Circle stand-up <a href="#2.-circle-stand-up-9-06" id="2.-circle-stand-up-9-06"></a>

There was no Circle Stand-up in this meeting, and the Prioritised Problems Board was not addressed.&#x20;

### Funded Proposer subcircle formation and funding clarification (Mercy, 13:44)

**Mercy (15:14)** How the FP subcircle emerged, with a focus on global perspectives and inviting representatives from different Town Halls\
**(17:21)** Used the Fund 7 Rapid Funding to set up the SubCircle, get it going, and run it from Feb to May; then submitted an F8 proposal to fund it from June to Sept. Then we have used Â£600 of our F8 Rapid Funding to fund translations of the proposer guidance notes into Spanish, Portuguese, French, Arabic and Swahili.\
**(18:46)** Outline of the work the Subcircle has been doing - extensive problem-sensing via regional TownHalls and day-to-day interactions; collating sensed problems on our Miro board and working through them; regular presence at Coordinator meetings to hold discussions and get feedback from proposers; working with IOG to get a more definite calendar for funding release; writing guidance notes for Ideascale and getting them translated; liaising with Nadia and the PA group, and contributing to the PA guidance notes. \
Happy to take any questions.

**Quasar (22:37)** I don't have any questions for Mercy. The comments I made about Mercy in Slack and in GitHub were not intended to question how funds were used, and were not meant to be personal. Dimitri and I were trying to figure out how to request funds from Rapid Funding.

**Nadia (26:19)** It's really easy for us to go to the source with each other and respectfully request information of someone if it's if it's needed. I think it's it's really challenging to have a team operate like a team, if we're not treating each other like we're all on the same team.&#x20;
